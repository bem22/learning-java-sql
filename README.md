### Christmas Crackers Database Management System

This project is not new at all, but I feel like it has never been appreciated enough, as I got 100% for building it back in December and the teacher never looked at the interesting features that I've implemented into it.


#### API's

For this project I've used a couple of API's. The RESTful API's I've used serve the purpose of populating the database with organic data.

#### What is organic data?

Organic data is represented by records, in my database, that look like they've been inputted by a real person. The "organic" element of my data is represented by its randomness, whereas the data presented tends to create disparity when compared with data created by machine.

#### Why organic data?

I used organic data and doubled the time spent building this project so I can have actual Jokes, names, etc.

(It's worth spending some time reading some of the geeky jokes).

You can find all the API's I've used inside the randomgen.md file.
